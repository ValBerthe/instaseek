        ## Manual
        
        This project aims to detect genuine and organic influencers on Instagram. The model is data-based and uses a machine learning approach :
        
        - Simple metrics such as followers, following, media count, mean engagement rate, post frequency, etc.
        - Comment quality score: is the audience engaged ?
        - Metrics over the feed images' quality : unity of contrast and colorfulness, redundancy of colors, etc.
        
        ## Script files
        
        - `annotation_tool.py` helped me to annotate influencers streamed in the database.
        - `classifier.py` lets you analyze an Instagram profile and classifies it among inlfuencer/not influencer.
        - `main.py` is the entrypoint. Currently, it lauches `streamer.py`.
        - `sql_client.py` is the SQL client. It processes and creates SQL requests to the database.
        - `streamer.py` streams Instagram content into the database.
        - `train.py` trains the model with data available in the database.
        - `user.py` processes user infomation and extracts feature for machine learning.
        - `utils.py` gathers all utility functions.
